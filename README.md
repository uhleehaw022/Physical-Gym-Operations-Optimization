# Physical Gym Operations Optimization Portfolio

## Challenge
Gym setup, equipment tracking, and daily operations lacked formal structure, leading to inefficiencies, inconsistent execution, and variability in member experience.



## Solution Overview
I designed and implemented standardized **physical workflows** and a comprehensive **Operations Binder** to improve efficiency, consistency, and safety across daily gym operations.

### Operational Workflow Design
- Defined structured workflows for class setup, breakdown, and equipment staging  
- Established equipment maintenance and inspection routines  
- Standardized member check-in and daily opening/closing procedures  

### Operations Binder Development
- Created a centralized Operations Binder to serve as the on-site source of truth  
- Documented procedures, policies, and safety protocols for staff reference  
- Developed all documentation in Google Docs, exported as PDFs, and printed for physical use  



## Impact
- Reduced class setup and cleanup time through standardized processes  
- Improved consistency in daily operations and service delivery  
- Enhanced member experience and overall satisfaction  
- Increased safety and staff confidence through clear procedures
