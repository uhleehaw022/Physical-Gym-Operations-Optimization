# Physical Gym Operations Optimization Portfolio

## Challenge
Gym setup, equipment tracking, and daily operations lacked structure, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistent member experience.

## Solution
- Designed **physical workflows** for class preparation, equipment maintenance, and member check-ins.
- Compiled a comprehensive **Operations Binder** including:
  - Equipment lists and maintenance schedules
  - Cleaning procedures and sanitation protocols
  - Emergency drills and safety procedures
  - Trainer onboarding and support guides
- All documentation created in Google Docs, saved as PDFs, and printed for use on-site.

## Impact
- Reduced setup and cleanup time
- Improved member experience and satisfaction
- Standardized operational processes for consistency and safety

## Key Sections in the Operations Binder
